# MuleMule
MuleSoft project
API-led connectivity approach

A framework that combines microservices architecture with a holistic API strategy to connect through well-defined layers, 
different types of pupose-built, resuable APIs designed with the consumption of data top of mind.

3 types of APIs
1. system APIs - provide us an access to the underlying core systems of record and expose data. (exposes backend database without business logic)
2. Process APIs - Typically, allow us to compose, transform, enrich, aggregate and orchestrate data as needed.
3. Experience APIs - Allow us to ease reconfigure data according to specific needs of the end user

What are the benefits of API-led aonnectivity?
01 Assests as APIs - use of APis to provide both a consumable and controlled means of accessing systems or applications
02 APIs are resuable and designed to be easily changes abd consumed across multiple applications
03 Faster development -APIs are resusable and designed to be easily changed and consumed across multiple applications
04 Improve governance - with APIS we can provide access to data and business logic in a governed and secured form
05 Transition to cloud- Speed up the transition of legacy systems to a cloud infrastructure easily and helps to innovate faster

How to get most out of the courses
1. watch or read over and over again until you understand it!
2. Hands on approach, do excercises
3. Ask questions
4. use MuleSoft documentation
5. Use Google

Installation 
1. install java 8
 create %JAVA_HOME%\bin to point the jdk, echo %JAVA_HOME%, echo %PATH%

2. Install Maven
    %MAVEN_HOME%\bin %M2_HOME%\bin
    echo %MAVEN_HOME
    echo %M2_HOME%

3. install Git
